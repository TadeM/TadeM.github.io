4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?

Answer
Unobtrusive Javascript is separting the script from the html. It means that rather than putting all the script
inside the html document we put the script in to a separte file and we make the html to refer that file.
The reason we are using it is to make the html more readable and Unobtrusive Javascript will alows us
to separate the website into 3 major catagories namely HTML(content), CSS (style) and Javascript(behavior)
